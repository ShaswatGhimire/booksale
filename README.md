This is my final project Capstone of CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript call BookSale.
BookSale is typically a web-application created with a view to making a move to commercial website. BookSale 
is a e-commerce website to buy books. This website is my final forged weapon integrating all my learnings from 
this course. 

My project booksale has an django app called store. In this app, I have 8 templates including layout.
Store.html is the index page showing all the current products. We can filter through products as our wish 
through filters on the left navigational pane. I have login/logout and register. I have cart.html which lists
all our products added to our cart. Cart uses cookies installed inside user browser so even products added from
non-logged in users remain there within the session. I also have checkout.html which queries checkout shipping address 
and payment. From django admin panel we can add products with their images also all our orders comes to our django's 
admin page from where we can deliver the product.

This is my first website created freely from scratch. I have used fetch calls inorder to make my site respond faster.
This project is also distinctive and complex because this project is in sole demand in the market with so many 
businesspersons demanding such sites for their business. So involving in such project makes me take a big leap towards
my entry into real world.
